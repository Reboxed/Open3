# Dear, Open3 Contributors
So you want to add your own mysteries to the codebase of yours truly? Well then fellow adventurer of the Open-Source lands, you may traverse the dangerous lands.

At a time long before the cloneathon, tis has been nothing but husk and dust, but then the mighty creator has made an invaluable discovery — A “YouTube”-community post of the creator “The - t3.gg”. What it is you may ask, traveler? It was a treasure. An invaluable treasure of potential $5K that may await him to support the creators' child — Reboxed.

Anyways, fun aside.

> The first steps for setting everything up can be found in README.md

But, there's some more things that require to be covered.

## Basic code style guides

- Double-quoted gang go brrr: "We do this", 'not this'.
- Everything must be written in English (US)
- Complex code must be documented via comments and file structure changes adjusted for in the README
- No no to implict any
- Explicit any may be used in precarious situations and more widely in dev branches
- Do not abstract stuff that doesn't need any abstraction (or for now)
- Do not prematurely optimize!!!
- We do not do DRY here, repeat yourself until it becomes too much (=3 is starting to be tight >3 times is a lot)
- You may use AI-assisted help, but do not "trust" the AI or let it solely do things i.e. via fully automated agents
- Roadmaps must be respected
- The cries for help left by other poor developers must be left in (I like reading and writing them)
- Our tabs are done with `4 spaces`.
- The file encoding should be UTF-8
- File line endings should be LF (not CLRF), idk if this actually causes any issues if it's mixed but I don't want to try it out
- No "magic numbers" or formulas, please use a well-named constant
- No indescriptive function or variable names
- Security should be #1 priority. If there's a comment telling someone to address a problem or anyone reporting any critical bugs, errors, or security vulnerabiltiies we must act on them immediately

Cool, I can't think of more for now but those are a good rule of thumb!
